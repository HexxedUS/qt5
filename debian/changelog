    qtwebkit is an exception, but they will anyway need SVN access.

    They are not needed anymore after the patches were submitted to the

  * [9093f9d] build system: use consistent target names for all modules.
    Force all top-level makefile rules to be named `module-$GITSUBMODULE',
    including the addition of the missing qlalr and qtqa targets.
    This naming convention must be upheld, otherwise there is no simple
    way to programmatically build a single git submodule and all of its
    dependencies.

    Will make 'diff', 'fetch', 'pull' etc ignore the submodules

    override this, when really needed.
    Very convenient when working with staging repos, instead of

  * [d4da74a] Remove platform-specific logic for qtactiveqt module.
    For the sake of a uniform test procedure, it is cleaner to have
    `make module-qtactiveqt' always working, but simply not building
    anything on platforms where ActiveQt is not supported.
    Without this, any test procedure for building Qt5 needs to be able
    to know or determine that ActiveQt should only be built on Windows.

    Pod::Usage shipped on OSX 10.6 seems to stop printing the usage
    message at the first `=headX'.  Refactor the documentation slightly to

  * [5feaf36] init-repository: mark as requiring perl 5.10.
    This script currently requires perl 5.10, so mark it as such.

  * [dcd1c8d] Update to new SHA in the QtWebKit repository.
    There was a mistake when pushing the modularized QtWebKit branch,
    which repushed the whole history of WebKit. This happened because the
    branch was based on the wrong SVN mirror.
    The proper SHA has been pushed to QtWebKit and this change reflects
    that in qt5.

  * [c250ff7] qtbase-earth-staging is no longer used, so remove it
  * [15b1485] Default to --ignore-submodules for --nokia-developer/--brisbane.
    When you use either --nokia-developer or --brisbane, changes
    are that you're going to be working on one of the submodules
    anyways, in which case, having git commands in top-level repo
    work on submodules too is an annoyance.
  * [3c8d0ab] Make all staging repos 'staging' remotes in submodules.
    This allows us to more easily use
        git submodule foreach
    since you can just refer to staging for the repo, like
    you would 'origin'.
  * [5d54ac9] Remove silly "goto" usage in foreach loop
  * [da3eb5c] Add 'staging' remote to repos which don't have a staging area.
    This makes it simpler to do
        git submodule foreach
    commands, since you don't need to worry about the repos without
    any staging area.
  * [c6f334f] Add option --codereview-user <username> to add Gerrit repos.
    By providing the username used for codereviews, the script will
    add the proper URLs for the repos currently under Gerrit control.
    For repos not under Gerrit control, 'gerrit' will simply refer
    to the staging repo, or origin.

    Before the transition is completely in place, init-repository

    a v8 submodule.
    This change causes git submodule init/update to be called for
    both repositories, even though one of them doesn't have any

  * [7c90fd8] init-repository: fixed src/3rdparty/v8 sometimes pointing at wrong SHA1.
    This script was doing a `git clone' for each submodule (so that we can
    use local mirrors), then using `git submodule update' to ensure all the
    submodules point to the right SHA1.
    Since this wasn't done recursively, a clean clone and init-repository
    would leave qtbase/src/3rdparty/v8 pointing at whatever SHA1 was set in
    the HEAD of qtbase, which is wrong.  Fix it by doing the update
    recursively.

    - git doesn't seem to remove the extra empty line after the subject any

  * [5f8a034] Updated qtquick1, qttools.
    The dependencies between these modules have recently been reversed (from

    Having a different dependency order when building the qt5.git versions
    of the modules, vs building the latest master of the modules, is
    confusing and disruptive.  Therefore, explicitly update these two
    modules separately from the usual submodule update procedure.

  * [725a51b] Remove qtjsondb from qt5.git.
    The jsondb module has been ongoing research work. But it won't be done
    in time for Qt 5.0, and is currently also less relevant. It's also
    currently not being actively worked on. So let's remove it
    from the list of modules compiled with qt5.git and keep it as
    research.
    The module can still be compiled stand-alone on top of the Qt essentials.

  * [877cec0] Fix make install with WebKit.
    Avoid running "make install" through build-webkit and therefore risk
    accidentally rebuilding the lot. We call build-webkit either with --release
    or without, but we never pass --debug. Therefore the build directory is
    always WebKitBuild/Release.
    This is a stop-gap for the Qt 5 beta. After the release we'll get rid of
    qtwebkit.pri altogether and WebKit will be built with just qmake and make.

    Git -- they should just download the actual repositories.
    Meanwhile, the .tag file is quite useful. Instead of making Git extract
    to the useless SHA-1 of the "$Id$\n" string, ask git-archive to store
    the SHA-1 of the commit being packaged.

  * [9b19587] Cut some build dependencies.
    A lot of modules had a hard depency on qtdeclarative
    (for extra qml components or qml examples).
    Now, these modules can be build without the need of qtdeclarative.
    These modules are:
    qttools (since 3b9ac2dc08310aa13b121274afea130fa4f7c6f8 )
    qtmultimedia (since 02f144ba6f50bb7d404e2808b9bb4fa32a206aea )
    qtsystems (since 12408d021af8b9f8e0afad7ae67f389974ed0607 )
    qtlocation (since fa404bfb7a83ecb01deb4df16d5ac72a8c5ab066 )
    qtsensors ( since 3c069e5e4a720582f37f0b2d053d19632f6ddfe2 )
    Also, useless dependencies are cut, and the dependencies declared
    in build.dependencis mirror more accurately what is done is qt.pro
    Those modifications allow an easier and faster build for people who
    do not use qml.
    Note that qtdelarative will still be needed to build the tests
    of each of the modules listed above

  * [9eefa9f] Fix parallel builds in WebKit.
    The parallel builds aborts because parallel execution of flex breaks
    due to the usage of the same temporary file names. This stems from
    using a hard coded temp file name "~flex_temp_out_main" and
    "random numbers" based on constants in mkstempFILE.
    Fixing those issues by embedding the current PID into the temp file
    names. Patch is in gnuwin32/patches/win_flex.patch

  * [571e52e] Prepare init-repository script for moving v8 submodule.
    Transitional step needed while v8 is moved from qtdeclarative
    to qtbase.
    Before the transition is completely in place, init-repository
    must be able to cope with both qtbase and qtdeclarative having
    a v8 submodule.
    This change causes git submodule init/update to be called for
    both repositories, even though one of them doesn't have any
    submodules. But in that case it's a no-op.

  * [7c90fd8] init-repository: fixed src/3rdparty/v8 sometimes pointing at wrong SHA1.
    This script was doing a `git clone' for each submodule (so that we can
    use local mirrors), then using `git submodule update' to ensure all the
    submodules point to the right SHA1.
    Since this wasn't done recursively, a clean clone and init-repository
    would leave qtbase/src/3rdparty/v8 pointing at whatever SHA1 was set in
    the HEAD of qtbase, which is wrong.  Fix it by doing the update
    recursively.

  * [9a924c6] Remove QtQuick3D repository references from Qt5.
    Qt3D had temporarily resided in the Qt5 repository under qtquick3d.
    There is now a qt3d submodule which is compiling and testing correctly.
    Qt5 had previously removed support for building the qtquick3d submodule
    by default. This commit is the final step in cleaning up the previous
    version.

  * [5f8a034] Updated qtquick1, qttools.
    The dependencies between these modules have recently been reversed (from
    qttools depending on qtquick1 to qtquick1 depending on qttools).
    Having a different dependency order when building the qt5.git versions
    of the modules, vs building the latest master of the modules, is
    confusing and disruptive.  Therefore, explicitly update these two
    modules separately from the usual submodule update procedure.

  * [877cec0] Fix make install with WebKit.
    Avoid running "make install" through build-webkit and therefore risk
    accidentally rebuilding the lot. We call build-webkit either with --release
    or without, but we never pass --debug. Therefore the build directory is
    always WebKitBuild/Release.
    This is a stop-gap for the Qt 5 beta. After the release we'll get rid of
    qtwebkit.pri altogether and WebKit will be built with just qmake and make.

    The .gitattributes, .gitignore, .commit-template files do not need to be
    present in packaged sources, as they are for people using the Git
    repository.  People who download tarballs usually don't reimport into
    Git -- they should just download the actual repositories.
    Meanwhile, the .tag file is quite useful. Instead of making Git extract
    to the useless SHA-1 of the "$Id$\n" string, ask git-archive to store
    the SHA-1 of the commit being packaged.

  * [9b19587] Cut some build dependencies.
    A lot of modules had a hard depency on qtdeclarative
    (for extra qml components or qml examples).
    Now, these modules can be build without the need of qtdeclarative.
    These modules are:
    qttools (since 3b9ac2dc08310aa13b121274afea130fa4f7c6f8 )
    qtmultimedia (since 02f144ba6f50bb7d404e2808b9bb4fa32a206aea )
    qtsystems (since 12408d021af8b9f8e0afad7ae67f389974ed0607 )
    qtlocation (since fa404bfb7a83ecb01deb4df16d5ac72a8c5ab066 )
    qtsensors ( since 3c069e5e4a720582f37f0b2d053d19632f6ddfe2 )
    Also, useless dependencies are cut, and the dependencies declared
    in build.dependencis mirror more accurately what is done is qt.pro
    Those modifications allow an easier and faster build for people who
    do not use qml.
    Note that qtdelarative will still be needed to build the tests
    of each of the modules listed above

  * [9eefa9f] Fix parallel builds in WebKit.
    The parallel builds aborts because parallel execution of flex breaks
    due to the usage of the same temporary file names. This stems from
    using a hard coded temp file name "~flex_temp_out_main" and
    "random numbers" based on constants in mkstempFILE.
    Fixing those issues by embedding the current PID into the temp file
    names. Patch is in gnuwin32/patches/win_flex.patch

    it would be possible to work around this by calling git checkout HEAD in

    instead, just make the module cloning already check out the desired

  * [fdf1b3c] rework hook installation
    the primary purpose of this change is making it work with new-style
    submodules (1.7+) and git-worktree (2.5+). this means resolving '.git'
    and 'commondir' files.
    we avoid calling git commands, because a) it's slow on windows, b) some
    of them are unavailable in older git versions and it's tedious to deal
    with that and c) their output is not necessarily optimal (not always
    absolute paths).
    we also don't use relative paths for the hook locations any more, as
    that's too tedious to deal with.

  * [84a1676] Update .gitmodules for automated release src package creation.
    Introduce new "deprecated" value for status attribute.
    We have two flavors of big source packages we need to produce:
    qt-everywhere-* which needs to include:
     - essential
     - addon
     - preview
     - deprecated (e.g. qtscript and qtenginio for Qt5.6 release)
    Installer only specific source package:
     - essential
     - addon
     The rest (deprecated, preview, ...) need to be shown as split src
     packages in the installer.
    The above leads to the following changes:
    qtscript: addon -> deprecated
     Needs to be part of big src packages but excluded from installer
     specific big source package.
    qtenginio: obsolete -> deprecated
     We can't exclude this module from qt-everywhere src packages.
    qtwayland: preview -> addon
     Needs to be part of installer specific big src package and the
     module status is not preview anymore.
